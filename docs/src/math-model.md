# The GasModels Mathematical Model

As GasModels implements a variety of gas network optimization problems, the implementation is the best reference for precise mathematical formulations.  This section provides a mathematical specification for a prototypical Gas Flow problem, to provide an overview of the typical mathematical models in GasModels.


## Steady State Gas Flow

GasModels implements a steady-state model of gas flow based on the Weymouth formulation that uses the 1-D hydrodynamic equations for natural gas flow in a pipe. In the following paragraphs, a derivation of the steady state equations used in GasModels is shown. To that end, we first assume that the flow is steady. Given this assumption, the conservation of momentum equation for the flow of gas in a pipe is given by

```math
p \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = -\frac{\lambda a^2 \phi |\phi|}{2 D}
```

where $p$ is pressure, $\lambda$ is a non dimensional friction factor, $\phi$ is mass flux, and $D$ is the diameter of the pipe. Here, $a^2=\frac{ZRT}{m}$ where $Z$ is the gas compressibility factor, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $m$ is the molar mass of the gas, and $T$ is the gas temperature. Again, for steady flow, the mass conservation reduces to:

```math
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}=0,
```

where we have assumed the pipe area does not change with $x$. We also assume that gas pressure and gas density ($\rho$) satisfy the equation of state, i.e. $p = a^2 \rho$


Given that $p \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}= \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial p^2}{\partial x}$ and $\phi$ is a constant througout the pipe (from the mass conservation), the conservation of momentum equation is integrated from the start of the pipe at $x=0$ to the end of the pipe at $x=L$, where $L$ is the length of the pipe. Then, the equation for flux across the pipe is stated as

```math
    p^2(L)-p^2(0) = \frac{-\lambda L a^2 \phi |\phi|}{ D }.
```

We typically express the mass flux through the pipe in terms of mass flow, $f$, where $f=\phi A$. Here, $A=\frac{\pi D^2}{4}$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Thus, the equation for mass flow through the pipe is stated as

```math
    p^2(L)-p^2(0) = \frac{-\lambda L a^2 f |f|}{ D A^2}.
```

To create a better numerically conditioned problem, it is very useful to non-dimensionalize the units. Here we use a typical pressure $p_0$ and a typical mass flow $f_0$ and normalize the equations. This yields

```math
    \tilde{p}^2(L)-\tilde{p}^2(0) = -\tilde{f} |\tilde{f}| \left(\frac{\lambda L }{D}\right) \left(\frac{f_0^2a^2}{A^2p_0^2}\right),
```

where $\tilde{f}=\frac{f}{f_0}$ and $\tilde{p}=\frac{p}{p_0}$ are the dimensionless mass flow and pressure, respectively, and are both of order one. Note that both terms in parenthesis on the right hand side of this equation are dimensionless.  For the purposes of convenience, we define *resistance*, $w$, as the constant

```math
w=\left(\frac{\lambda L }{D}\right) \left(\frac{f_0^2a^2}{A^2p_0^2}\right).
```  

Finally, in most data sets, nodal injections and withdrawals are defined in terms of volumetric flow, $q$, at a STP conditions. Given this data, we non-dimensionalize based on $q$. At STP conditions, the mass flow is derived as $f=\frac{q}{\rho_s}$, where  $\rho_s$ is the gas density at STP conditions.

A complete gas flow mathematical model is the defined by

&p_j - v_a \overline{p}_j \leq p_i \leq p_j + v_a \overline{p}_i & \text{links junction pressures of valve $a$} \\
&& \text{connected from junction $i$ to junction $j$}
\end{aligned}
```

most of the optimization models of GasModels are variations of this formulation. In practice, we discretize on flow direction to reduce the non convexities of this model and relax the assumption that the minimum compression ratio is 1.

## Transient Gas Flow

The transient gas flow dynamics implements a lumped element reduced-order model presented in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8412133/) and its ([arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07156)). An interested reader is referred to that work for detailed development of the dynamics.
