## Overview

GasModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for Gas Network Optimization. It provides utilities for parsing and modifying network data (see [GasModels Network Data Format](@ref) for details), and is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging gas network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. It includes support for steady-state and transient formulations.

The code is engineered to decouple [Problem Specifications](@ref) (e.g. Gas Flow, Expansion Planning, ...) from [Network Formulations](@ref) (e.g. MINLP, MISOCP-relaxation, ...). This enables the definition of a wide variety of gas network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.

## Installation

The latest stable release of GasModels is installed using the Julia package manager with

```julia
add GasModels
```

For the current development version, "checkout" this package with

```julia
checkout GasModels
```

At least one optimizer is required for running GasModels.  The open-source optimizer Juniper is recommended and can be used to solve a wide variety of the problems and network formulations provided in GasModels.  The Juniper optimizer can be installed via the package manager with

```julia
add Juniper
```

Test that the package works by running

```julia
test GasModels
```
